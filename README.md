# KuaiJi  

## Overview

**KuaiJi** is an iOS app for **AA bill-splitting** and **personal bookkeeping**.  
Its goals are simple:  
1. Make group gatherings, trips, and shared apartments free from manual debt calculations.  
2. Help manage your personal finances efficiently.

The app is built entirely with **Swift + SwiftUI**, requires **no server**, and runs fully **offline**.  
However, it still supports **Bluetooth / Wi-Fi** synchronization between devices, providing a kind of “pseudo-distributed” shared experience.  
> The developer simply didn’t want to pay Apple’s USD 99 annual developer fee. ~~(Currently has raised $10 among friends.)~~

> Therefore, CloudKit is not an option — decentralized accounting is the only way!

## Developer Notes

* This is my first project built from scratch, and I’m proud of it — from code to UI to distribution, everything was a challenge I managed to overcome.  
* It’s not on the App Store yet because of a **“decentralized pricing policy”** — I just refuse to pay the USD 99 developer fee for now.  
* I started with some Python and tkinter experience. SwiftUI feels like Apple’s own tkinter — just shinier.
